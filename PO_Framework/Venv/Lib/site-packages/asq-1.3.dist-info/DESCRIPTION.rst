``asq`` is simple implementation of a LINQ-inspired API for Python which
operates over Python iterables, including a parallel version implemented in
terms of the Python standard library multiprocessing module.

What It Does
============

``asq`` is a package implementing queries over iterables of Python
objects.  `asq` provides a fluent interface making extensive use of method
chaining to create complex queries without compromising readability.  For
example, to take the first five uppercased results from a list of words sorted
by length and then alphabetically, try::

  >>> from asq import query
  >>> words = ["zero", "one", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six", "seven", "eight", "nine", "ten"]
  >>> query(words).order_by(len).then_by().take(5).select(str.upper).to_list()
  ['ONE', 'SIX', 'TEN', 'TWO', 'FIVE']

Over 40 standard query operators are provided together with various utilities
to make the API even more convenient to use in Python.

How to get it
=============

``asq`` is available on the Python Package Index and can be installed with
easy_install from setuptools::

  $ pip install asq

Alternatively you can download and unpack the source and install using::

  $ cd asq-1.2
  $ python setup.py install

Requirements
============

This version of ``asq`` works with  and 2.7 and higher, including Python 3.
It is tested on Python 2.7, Python 3.3, Python 3.4 and Python 3.5.
Furthermore it is tested on IronPython 2.7.
